## Introduction

Hi, my name is Kyle Monteiro and I am a third year student at the University of Guelph majoring in Computer Science, and this past term I was able to dip my toe into the software industry with my first term of coop! The weeks leading up to the job were a mix of emotions. On one hand I was anxious that my output would be looked at and judged, that I might not get along with my coworkers, or that I might not be able to bare sitting at a desk all day, but also I couldn't wait to push myself and learn some new things and experience what probably going to be my career for the rest of my life. I say "probably" because the fact is, I had a blast on my first work term.

## The Job

In early summer 2019, I was hired as a Front-End Developer for a medical company called PerkinElmer, located in Guelph, Ontario, as part of the Clinical Research And Development division of the company. The company itself is massive with over 11,000 employees worldwide, however I was most fortunate to work with a team of around 15 others, including two other coop students, all of which made me feel very welcome, mentored me and treated me as an equal who had valuable input. Immediately my perception of the supposedly cutthroat workforce was shattered. I was surrounded by people who were willing to take time out of the own tasks to help me get up to speed. It took some time, especially after close to three weeks of watching training videos all day, but once I knew what was going on, I was flying through the tasks at hand.

## My Experience

The product we were working on was a cloud-based web app for doctors and other medical professionals to use to manage clinical trial data. In the past, doctors would sit and stare at printed out spreadsheets, with thousands of rows, trying to pick out certain subjects that they were interested in for their research. This process was extremely slow and the product that we developed at PerkinElmer is the solution. The product allows users to set up their studies and connect the source for their trial data, after which they will be able to review the data in a much cleaner and easier format to read. Through the use of interactive visualizations and other features a medical reviewer is able to isolate and review the data they are interested in with ease.

Like I said earlier, I was hired as a front-end developer and so my responsibility was primarily with visual changes to the website and logic regarding the way the user interacted with the elements on the web app. The application was build using AngularJS, a framework for JavaScript, which coming into the term I had never touched before. To make it even harder, some of the program files were written in JavaScript, while others were written in TypeScript, another language I had never used before. That's not it either. Until my final two weeks on the job, there was no other front-end developer employed, and so I either had to figure out everything on my own, or seek help from on of my coworkers who were just about as unfamiliar with code as I was.

Luckily my issue that was assigned to me was to upgrade the version of AngularJS on the website, which happened to come with a lot of breaking changes and so I had a great, yet tedious, opportunity to get very familiar with the code. That first task took me just over two weeks, however coming out of it, I had a very good understanding of how the front-end of the website worked and what could be done to improve it. Following that issue, I started to work on smaller bugs that impacted the end users as opposed to upgrading a version with no real visible or logical change. This is when I got to really practice my ability to problem solve and deduce potential logical errors, and so it was extremely gratifying and helped motivate me to push myself. Eventually I got to a point where I was solving most issues within a day, and sometimes even multiple a day. I was ready for a new challenge, and with about a month and a half left I was eager for a bigger task.

## Migrating

As stated above, the front end was developed using two different programming languages: JavaScript and TypeScript. The reason for this is because the plan was to slowly convert the web app from AngularJS to Angular, which is a newer version of the framework built upon the TypeScript language. Since TypeScript files can also be used with AngularJS, the idea was that we would convert all the JavaScript files into TypeScript first, which would ease the transition from AngularJS to Angular. Most of this was already done, however there were a few files left that needed to be created/converted, and so I reached out to some of the members of the team to see if I could take on this task, and sure enough they said okay.

For the next month I juggled my time addressing new bugs that were popping up that needed to be resolved for a mid-December release, while also converting some of the remaining files to TypeScript components. This ended up being a much bigger task than I had anticipated, which I only came to understand after realizing that they way the previous files had been converted were not correct. They somehow worked, but would not be very helpful for the end goal. As a result, I had to completely restructure how these components were made and interacted with each other
